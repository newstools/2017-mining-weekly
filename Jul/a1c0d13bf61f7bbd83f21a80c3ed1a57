PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Coal developer Aspire Mining has flagged a $4-million to $5-million capital reduction at its proposed Nuurstei project, in Mongolia. The company on Friday told shareholders that it had received capital estimates of between $10-million and $12-million for its 150 t/h wash plant at the Nuurstei project, while mining contractor Ferrostaal Mining Services has provided an indicative estimate of between $5.75-million and $7.75-million for local infrastructure and services to support the development of the project. Aspire noted that the two estimates reflected a capital saving of between $4-million and $5-million to the $20-million to $25-million cost estimate previously provided for the Nuurstei project.
