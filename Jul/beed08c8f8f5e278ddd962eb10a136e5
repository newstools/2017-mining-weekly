PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Saracen Mineral Holdings has awarded preferred tenderer status to contractor Byrnecut Australia for the A$440-million underground mining contract at its Carosue Dam operation, in Western Australia. The formal award of the contract is subject to agreement on final terms and conditions. Saracen MD Raleigh Finlayson said on Friday that Saracen was looking forward to partnering with Byrnecut to build on the safe and highly productive underground mining operation at Carosue Dam. “This is the largest single contract in Saracen’s history, with the scale and duration of the contract driven by our confidence in a large and rapidly growing gold system at Carosue Dam,” he said. The contract relates to the underground development and production stoping at the Karari and Deep South underground mines, with the contract expected to run an initial four years with scope for a one-year extension at Saracen’s election.
