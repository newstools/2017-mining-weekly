JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Aim-listed Weatherly International’s Tschudi mine, in Namibia, produced 14 759 t of copper cathode in the financial year ended June 30, in line with guidance, but 13% below its 17 000 t/y nameplate capacity. C1 cash costs of $5 288/t were also in line with guidance of $5 250/t to $5 350/t. Construction of the extended heap leach pad area continues on schedule, while investigations are also continuing into how leach rates can be improved under modified operating conditions. Weatherly has appointed an independent consultant to provide guidance and advice into leach rates and the ultimate recoveries that can be expected. Meanwhile, Weatherly has also entered into an uncommitted $10-million finance facility with Orion Mine Finance. The proceeds will be used to accelerate the building of the leach pads and fund operating costs and general working capital requirements at Tschudi.
