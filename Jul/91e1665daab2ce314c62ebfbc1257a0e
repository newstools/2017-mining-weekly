JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Nickel/copper sulphide explorer Amur Minerals believes it has expanded the mining potential of its Kun-Manie mine, in Russia’s Far East, with recent drilling at the Kubuk deposit having added as much as another three years to its production. Drilling to identify indicated resources has extended the limits of the mineralisation by about 50% from that of the February 2017 resource model, which contains 14.5-million ore tonnes and a total of 112 000 nickel tonnes (at 77%) and 30 000 t of copper (at 0.20%). The newly defined mineralisation has an average thickness per drill hole of 14.3 m, compared with 21.5 m in the resource model, averaging 0.78% nickel and 0.20% copper. Amur believes the newly defined mineralisation has the potential to significantly expand the underground mining potential at Kubuk. CEO Robin Young said substantial resource expansion potential remained at both ends of the Kubuk deposit. “More than 3 000 m of target length remains to be drilled, with the largest potential being located in the west toward our Ikenskoe/Sobolevsky deposit,” he said. Successful drilling along the west could result in the joining of the IKEN and Kubuk deposits to create a single large deposit of more than 4 km in total length. The second target lies to the east of Kubuk, identified by geochemical sampling and trenching. This 1 km long target area also requires drilling. In the near future, drilling will shift to the eastern target to allow for the safe construction of drill roads and drill pads located at the western limits of the newly defined mineral limits. Once completed, the focus of drilling will shift back to the western target.
